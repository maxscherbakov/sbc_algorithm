/// A trait defining the clustering behavior for similarity-based chunking.
///
/// The `Clusterer` trait groups chunks, identified by their similarity hashes,
/// into clusters of related chunks. This is a key step in similarity-based chunking
/// workflows to identify chunks that can be efficiently encoded as deltas.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `Hash` - The hash type implementing `SBCHash` that identifies chunks.
///
/// # Methods
///
/// * `clusterize` - Takes a vector of chunk similarity points and returns clusters grouping them.

    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A collection of clusters, where each cluster is a grouping of related chunks.
